# galactic-hero
 
Simple space shooting game demo.
Reference from peterhellberg - "https://gist.github.com/peterhellberg/ac9f10c9559bdcc7296a.js"

Use 'up', 'down', 'left' and 'right' to move your character. Press 'space' to shoot. 

Update:
- galaxy background
- enemies AI shooting
- difficult levels increasing, the higher point you get, the harder the game is
- sfx and music
- best score anouncement
- there's also a small special mode that I've put in the game when you reach a certain highscore. Go check for it!
